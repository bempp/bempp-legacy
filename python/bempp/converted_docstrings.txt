Abstract boundary operator.

An AbstractBoundaryOperator represents a linear mapping $L : X \\\\to
Y$ between two function spaces $X : S \\\\to K^p$ (_domain_) and $Y :
T \\\\to K^q$ (_range_) defined on $n$-dimensional surfaces $S$ and
$T$ embedded in an $(n+1)$-dimensional domain. $K$ denotes either the
set of real or complex numbers. The surfaces $S$ and $T$ may be equal.

The function assembleWeakForm() can be used to construct the weak form
of the operator.

BasisFunctionType_ Type of the values of the (components of the) basis
functions into which functions acted upon by the operator are
expanded.  ResultType_ Type used to represent elements of the weak
form of the operator.

Both template parameters can take the following values: float, double,
std::complex<float> and std::complex<double>. Both types must have the
same precision: for instance, mixing float with std::complex<double>
is not allowed. If BasisFunctionType_ is set to a complex type, then
ResultType_ must be set to the same type.

Operator acting on functions defined on a surface.

A BoundaryOperator is a lightweight wrapper of a pair of shared
pointers to an AbstractBoundaryOperator and a DiscreteBoundaryOperator
representing the weak form of the former. The weak form is evaluated
lazily, on the first call to weakForm(). The Context object passed to
the constructor of the BoundaryOperator or to the initialize()
function determines how this weak form is calculated.

Different threads should not share BoundaryOperator objects, since
notably the weakForm() function is not thread-safe. Instead, each
thread should hold its own copy of a BoundaryOperator (note that
copying BoundaryOperators is cheap -- the copy constructor is
shallow).  See the documentation of AbstractBoundaryOperator for the

path:  Directory where to put the parallel collection (.pvtu/.pvtp)

Assembly context.

This class manages the assembly of weak forms and evaluation of
potentials.

An assembly context consists of a quadrature strategy, which
determines the way integrals are calculated, and assembly options,
which control higher-level aspects of weak-form assembly, e.g. the use
or not of acceleration algorithms such as ACA and the level of
parallelism.

A call to the Context::getWeakForm() function returns the weak form of
the abstract boundary operator passed in the argument to this
function, assembled using the settings from the given Context. The
Context may store the weak form in an internal cache; see the
documentation of getWeakForm() for more details.

C++ includes: context.hpp ";

Parameters:
-----------

quadStrategy:  Quadrature strategy to be used for calculation of

process. ";

Return the weak form of the specified abstract operator.

This function returns returns the weak form of the specified abstract
boundary operator, calculated in accordance with the settings
specified during the construction of the Context.

An important design principle in BEM++ is that abstract boundary
operators are immutable after construction. The same is true for
Context objects. Therefore, a Context stores newly calculated weak
forms in an internal cache, unless a given abstract boundary operator
does not provide a valid unique identifier (see
AbstractBoundaryOperator::id()). As long as the weak form remains in
cache, subsequent calls to Context::getWeakForm() with the same
abstract boundary operator will not recalculate the weak form, but
return the cached instance. It should, however, be noted that the
cache does not maintain a persistent relationship with weak forms: it
stores them as weak rather than shared pointers. Therefore, a weak
form is deallocated as soon as the last reference to it *apart from
that residing in the cache* goes out of scope. ";

Discrete boundary operator.

This class represents a discretised boundary operator, i.e. a matrix
$\\\\mathsf{L}$ with entries \\\\[ \\\\mathsf{L}_{mn} \\\\equiv
\\\\int_S \\\\phi^*_m(x) \\\\,[L\\\\, \\\\psi_n](x)\\\\,
\\\\mathrm{d}S(x), \\\\] where $L$ is a boundary operator,
$\\\\{\\\\phi_m\\\\}_{m=1}^{M}$ are the basis functions spanning a
*test space* and defined on a surface $S$, whereas
$\\\\{\\\\psi_n\\\\}_{n=1}^{N}$ are the basis functions of a *trial
space*. The way the matrix is stored can be arbitrary. Concrete
subclasses of this class implement specific storage methods.

If BEM++ is compiled with Trilinos, this class is derived from
Thyra::LinearOpDefaultBase<ValueType> and hence inherits all non-
private member function of this class; seeTrilinos documentation for
full documentation of these functions.

If Trilinos is not available during compilation, a simple fallback
interface is provided.

ValueType Type used to represent entries of the operator matrix. It
can take the following values: float, double, std::complex<float> and
std::complex<double>.

\\\\rangle \\\\equiv \\\\int_\\\\Gamma \\\\int_\\\\Gamma F[\\\\phi(x),
\\\\psi(y)] \\\\, d\\\\Gamma(x) \\\\, d\\\\Gamma(y), \\\\] where
$\\\\Gamma$ is a surface embedded in a space of dimension higher by
one and the integrand $F[\\\\phi(x), \\\\psi(y)]$ is an arbitrary
bilinear (or sesquilinear) form of the *test function* $\\\\phi$
belonging to the space dual to the range of $\\\\mathcal A$ and the
*trial function* $\\\\psi$ belonging to the domain of $\\\\mathcal A$.
In the simplest and most common case, $F[\\\\phi(x), \\\\psi(y)]$ is

\\\\psi(y), \\\\] where $K(x, y)$ is a *kernel function* and the
asterisk denotes complex conjugation. For more complex operators, $F$
might involve some transformations of the test and trial functions
(e.g. their surface divergence or curl), the kernel function might be
a tensor, or $F$ might consist of several terms. The exact form of $F$
for a particular boundary operator is determined by the implementation
of the virtual functions integral(), kernels(), testTransformations()

BasisFunctionType_ Type of the values of the (components of the) basis

The use of this function is to compute the gradient of some function

$\\\\hat{f}(x) = f(g(x))$ and apply the chain rule we obtain

Adjoint double-layer-potential boundary operator for the modified
Helmholtz equation in 3D.

BasisFunctionType_ Type of the values of the basis functions into
which functions acted upon by the operator are expanded.  KernelType_
Type of the values of the kernel functions occurring in the integrand
of the operator.  ResultType_ Type used to represent elements of the
weak form form of the operator.

The latter three template parameters can take the following values:
float, double, std::complex<float> and std::complex<double>. All types

for BasisFunctionType_ = double and KernelType_ = std::complex<double>
it is set to std::complex<double>. You should override that only if

%feature("docstring") Bempp::NumericalQuadratureStrategy "

Numerical quadrature strategy.

A quadrature strategy provides functions constructing local assemblers
used to discretize boundary operators and user-defined functions. A
particular quadrature strategy determines how the integrals involved
in this discretization are evaluated.

The local assemblers constructed by this class use numerical
quadrature to evaluate the necessary integrals. Singular integrals are
transformed into regular ones as described in S. Sauter, Ch. Schwab,
\"Boundary Element Methods\" (2010). Quadrature accuracy can be
influenced by parameters given during the construction.

C++ includes: numerical_quadrature_strategy.hpp ";

%feature("docstring")
Bempp::NumericalQuadratureStrategy::NumericalQuadratureStrategy "

Construct a numerical quadrature strategy with default accuracy
settings.

Calling this constructor is equivalent to calling the other
constructor with accuracyOptions equal to AccuracyOptions(). ";

%feature("docstring")
Bempp::NumericalQuadratureStrategy::NumericalQuadratureStrategy "

Construct a numerical quadrature strategy with prescribed accuracy
settings.

The quadrature order for different types of integrals is determined in
the following way:

The field accuracyOptions.doubleRegular controls the evaluation of
double integrals of the form \\\\[ \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma}
\\\\int_{\\\\Sigma} f(x, y) \\\\, d\\\\Gamma(x) \\\\, d\\\\Sigma(y),
\\\\] where $\\\\Gamma$ and $\\\\Sigma$ are two disjoint elements and
$f(x, y)$ is a function regular for $x \\\\in \\\\Gamma$ and $y \\\\in
\\\\Sigma$. An integral of the above form is approximated by \\\\[
\\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\sum_{j=1}^n w_i^m w_j^n \\\\, f(x_i^m, y_j^n),
\\\\] where $x_i^m$ and $y_j^n$ are appropriate quadrature points and
$w_i^m$ and $w_j^n$ are the corresponding quadrature weights. By
default, these are chosen so that the order of accuracy of the
quadrature of each element is equal to the maximum degree of the
polynomials belonging to the basis attached to that element. In other
words, the quadrature rule is chosen so that a function $f(x, y)$
being a product of two polynomials, $u(x)$ and $v(y)$, with degrees
equal to the orders of the bases attached to elements $\\\\Gamma$ and
$\\\\Sigma$ would be integrated exactly. For instance, for a pair of
elements endowed with linear bases, single-point quadrature is by
default used on both elements.

This default integration order may be insufficient. It can be
increased e.g. by calling where n is the desired increase of the order
of accuracy of the quadrature on each element above the default value.
Alternatively, can be called to use a quadrature rule with order of
accuracy n on each element.

The field accuracyOptions.doubleSingular controls the evaluation of
double integrals of the same form as above, but on pairs of elements
$\\\\Gamma$ and $\\\\Sigma$ sharing at least a single point and with
the function $f(x, y)$ having a singularity at $x = y$. Such integrals
are evaluated by first applying an appropriate coordinate
transformation to remove the singularity of the integrand, as
described in the book of Sauter and Schwab cited before, and then
approximating the new integral with a tensor-product Gaussian
quadrature rule with order of accuracy in each dimension choosen by
default as $\\\\max(p, q) + 5$, where $p$ and $q$ are the orders of
the bases attached to elements $\\\\Gamma$ and $\\\\Sigma$.

The field accuracyOptions.singleRegular controls the evaluation of
integrals over single elements \\\\[ \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma} f(x) \\\\,
d\\\\Gamma(x) \\\\] of regular functions $f(x)$. They are evaluated
using a Gaussian quadrature rule with order of accuracy taken by
default as twice the order of the basis attached to the element
$\\\\Gamma$. ";

%feature("docstring") Fiber::DefaultTestKernelTrialIntegral "

Standard implementation of the TestKernelTrialIntegral interface.

The evaluate*() member functions can be used to evaluate integrals of
the form

\\\\[ \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_i} dx \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_j} dy \\\\, I[f(x),
g(y)] \\\\],

where the integrand $I(x, y)$ depends in an arbitrary way on the test
function $f(x)$ and the trial function $f(y)$.

This class template takes a single template parameter,
IntegrandFunctor, which should stand for a type providing the
following interface:

The addGeometricalDependencies() method should specify any geometrical
data on which the integral depends explicitly (not through the kernels
or basis function transformations). For example, if the integrand
depends on the vectors normal to the surface at test and trial points,
the function could have the form

The evaluate() method should compute the integrand -- excluding the
quadrature weights! -- at a single (test point, trial point) pair. It
is supplied with the following parameters:

Parameters:
-----------

testGeomData:  Geometric data at a single test point.

trialGeomData:  Geometric data at a single trial point.

testTransformations:  Values of a collection of transformations of a
single test function at the test point.

trialTransformations:  Values of a collection of transformations of a
single trial function at the trial point.

kernels:  Values of a collection of kernels at the (test point, trial
point) pair.

Todo Perhaps implement IntegrandFunctor using the curiously recurring
template pattern.
