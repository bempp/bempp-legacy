# This file controls the build settings for BEM++.
# You need to at least do the following.

# Specify the architecture and prefix in the [Main]
# section.

# Choose a BLAS and Lapack library. Enable either MKL (recommended)
# or choose a BLAS and Lapack library manually. Please see the 
# README for recommended options.

# It is highly recommended to download and enable AHMED in the [AHMED]
# section. This enables the H-Matrix algebra for the library and 
# allows to solve significantly larger problems than with a standard
# dense matrix BEM.

[Main]

# Specify your system architecture. Allowed values: intel64 (for
# 64-bit systems), ia32 (for 32-bit systems), Example:

architecture=intel64

# By default BEM++ and its dependencies will be built in the
# subdirectory "build" of the BEM++ source directory. You can override
# this by setting the option below. Example:

# build_dir=~/src/bempp-build

# Specify the prefix of the installation directory.  BEM++ and its
# dependencies will be installed in prefix/bempp. Example:

prefix=~

# It is highly recommended to adapt the number of threads used to 
# build the library to the number of underlying CPU cores. A good rule 
# of thumb is to choose build_jobs = 1.5*(number of cores), e.g. for 
# a dual-core system choose build_jobs=3. This significantly speeds 
# up the compilation process.

build_jobs=2

# The following options control the compilers and compiler flags.
# You can override the options for specific libraries by setting
# these options within the corresponding section.

# C Compiler
# cc = gcc

# C++ Compiler
# cxx = g++

# C Compiler flags
# cflags =

# C++ Compiler flags
cxxflags = -std=c++11

# Optimization flags
# optflags = -O3 -march=native (Default on Linux)
# optflags = -O3 -march=core2 (Default on Mac)

[Bempp]

# Specify whether the installer should compile BEM++ straight after
# installing its dependencies. Normally this should be set to 'yes';
# set to 'no' only if you want to change some BEM++ compilation
# options manually. Example:

# build=yes

[MKL]

# If you want to use BLAS and LAPACK from Intel MKL, uncomment the
# following line

# enable_mkl=yes

# and specify where the MKL libraries can be found.

# If the NumPy package in your Python distribution is linked against
# MKL (for example, you use Enthought Python), uncomment the following
# line to have the BEM++ installer use the same MKL libraries as
# NumPy.

# source=like_numpy

# Otherwise, you need to specify manually the location of MKL on your disk.
# Uncomment the following line

# source=installed

# and specify the directories containing the MKL libraries (such
# as libmkl_core and libiomp5) in the following variable. You may
# specify several directories at once by separating them with
# semicolons. Example:

# dir=/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64;/opt/intel/lib/intel64

# You can also customize the list of MKL libraries to link against
# by editing the following variable. The default setting below
# (-lmkl_rt) should work for MKL 10.3 or newer. In case of
# problems use the Intel MKL Link Line Advisor
# (http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor)
# to find the setting appropriate for your configuration. You may
# specify several libraries at once by separating them with
# semicolons.

# lib=-lmkl_rt

[BLAS]

# If you want to use another BLAS library than Intel MKL, specify its
# location in the following variable. You may specify several paths at
# once by separating them with semicolons. Example:

# lib=/usr/lib/libblas.so

[LAPACK]

# If you want to use another BLAS library than Intel MKL, specify its
# location in the following variable. You may specify several paths at
# once by separating them with semicolons. Example:

# lib=/usr/lib/liblapack.so

[AHMED]

# Uncomment the following line if you have downloaded the AHMED
# library by Mario Bebendorf from
# http://bebendorf.ins.uni-bonn.de/AHMED.html and you want to compile
# and install it along with BEM++. This library enables BEM++ to use
# the adaptive cross approximation algorithm to speed up calculations.

# enable_ahmed=yes

# If you have set enable_ahmed to yes, specify the path to the archive
# file with the sources of AHMED. Example:

# file_name=~/Downloads/AHMED-1.0.tar.gz

# Use this section to override compiler settings for AHMED

[Boost]
# Use this section to override compiler settings for Boost

[Dune]
# Use this section to override compiler settings for Dune

[Swig]
# Use this section to override compiler settings for Swig

[Trilinos]
# Use this section to override compiler settings for Trilinos


[MPI]

# Enable MPI support and specify the MPI include directory and MPI 
# libraries here. If you use MPI compier wrappers (e.g. mpicxxx and mpicc)
# you just have to uncomment enable_mpi = true to enable MPI support. If
# compiler wrappers are not used then additionally the mpi include directory
# and mpi libraries need to be specified. The given example configuration is
# for OpenMPI. Please note that this is experimental and currently only used
# to compile the PyTrilinos solvers with MPI support.

# enable_mpi = true
# mpi_cxx_libs = -L/usr/local/openmpi/lib -lmpi_cxx -lmpi
# mpi_include_dir = /usr/local/openmpi/include



[Python]

# You do not normally need to edit this section. However, if the BEM++
# installer cannot find your Python include directory (the directory
# containing Python.h) or runtime library (libpython), you can specify
# their locations explicitly here. Examples:

# include_dir=/usr/include/python2.7
# lib=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so
